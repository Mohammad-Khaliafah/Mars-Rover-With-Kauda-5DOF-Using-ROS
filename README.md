## Introduction
The Mars Rover project aims to develop a functional rover that can navigate the harsh Martian terrain, collect samples, and perform environmental analysis. This repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to replicate the project.

## Hardware Components
- **DC Motors**: 
  - Used for driving the wheels and operating the robotic arm.
  - Provide sufficient torque and speed to navigate rough terrain and perform precise movements for sample collection.
- **BTS7960 Motor Drivers**: 
  - Control the DC motors with high current capacity.
  - Ensure proper heat dissipation and reliable motor operation.
- **LiPo Battery**: 
  - Powers the entire rover.
  - Provides a high energy density to ensure long operational time.
- **Sensors**: 
  - Methane, hydrogen, and ozone sensors for environmental analysis.
  - Encoder sensors for wheel position feedback and speed measurement.
  - Ultrasonic and infrared sensors for obstacle detection.

## Mechanical Design
- **Six-Wheel Drive with Four-Wheel Steering**: 
  - Ensures stability and maneuverability on uneven terrain.
  - Each wheel is powered independently, allowing for better traction and control.
- **Suspension System**: 
  - Enables traversal over rough surfaces.
  - Absorbs shocks and maintains rover stability, reducing the risk of tipping over.
- **Fabrication Techniques**: 
  - Components are fabricated using 3D printing and laser cutting.
  - Ensures precision, durability, and lightweight construction.

## Electrical Design
- **Custom PCB Design**: 
  - Integrates all electronic components, including sensors, motors, and the power supply.
  - Designed to handle the electrical load and provide reliable connections.
- **Power Management**: 
  - Manages power distribution from the LiPo battery to all components.
  - Includes voltage regulators to ensure consistent and safe power supply.
- **Motor Drivers**: 
  - BTS7960 drivers control the DC motors.
  - Provide high current capability and protect motors from overheating.

## Software Design
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: 
  - Used for developing and deploying control software.
  - Provides a flexible framework for writing robot software.
- **Control Algorithms**: 
  - Implemented PID control for motor speed and direction.
  - Ensures precise and smooth control of the roverâ€™s movements.
- **Navigation and Path Planning**: 
  - Developed robust algorithms for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
  - Includes SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for mapping the environment.
- **Sample Collection Module**: 
  - Programmed 5-DOF robotic arm for precise sample collection.
  - Controlled through ROS, allowing for complex manipulation tasks.
